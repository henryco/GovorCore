JAVA8+ requested, also linux ubuntu request installed javafx libraries.
With any questions, please contact with me: hd2files@{google.mail}
Program also works on Win7, on Win8 and Win10 possible troubles with libraries.
To run on window you need to configure "config.struct" file before, and then run GovorCore.jar
If you use linux, then run installation script, it will download and install requested 
libraries, and create runnable start scrpits for client and server version.
